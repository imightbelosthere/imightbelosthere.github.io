## Who's hands behind the keyboard?

I guess that's a fair question to ask, but I'll try my best to keep this in a way that I respect my privacy, but I can say that I'm an IT Security Professional, who's been an [hacker] its whole life and got driven *always* through self-motivation.

I had of course on my side my friends, my wife and professionals who challenged me along the way to become better and learn from each and every mistake and successes I've done through this path.

Don't get confused... I'm what you'd classify as a *[white hat]* as I invest my effort on making others more aware of the dangers and the holes in the security around them. I was always incentivized to look at what's around me, how it works, how things *tick* and specially, how people will react towards a certain situation.

Since we're talking about clarification and removing some confusions out of the way, here are some questions answered about this blog and its author...

## What's the blog about?

It will be mainly about IT Security and some technologies, methods and paths or ways to define a more protective and secure internet presence.

I might at some points also post some humour, or silly stuff... That's just how I am... I like to laugh as I believe life can't be taken too seriously... *We won't come alive out of it* as some say.

## What's the blog objective then?

Create security awareness for everyone... Allow everyone to make themselves more secure on the internet and avoid getting exposed to dangers that might damage their life, image or safety even. At the same time keep tabs on learnings, lessons and share that information for others to learn and empower them to get higher and farther than ever.
